#Presidents Slide Show

##Overview

In this application I display a web page with information about the president. A user can click next and previous buttons to scroll through the presidents in order. The user can
also jump to a particular president by entering their term number. 

Note: This app was built before I learned database technologies. Data is parsed from a CSV.

##Technologies Used

Java, CSS, HTML, JSP, Tomcat, XML
